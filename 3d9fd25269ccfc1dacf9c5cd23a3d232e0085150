Lift 1024 open files limit (switch to curl polling API)

Strict upper bound for file limit was hardcoded into Transmission because
`select()` is unable to handle file descriptors greater than FD_SETSIZE
(usually 1024).

The only place where `select()` was used is `libtransmission/web.c` - as a part
of `curl_multi_*` invocation. Curl has long provided an alternative polling
interface to avoid hitting that limit. This commit replaces curl's older API
(`curl_multi_fdset()` + `select()`) with new polling API (`curl_multi_wait()`)
and removes FD_SETSIZE as the upper bound on the number of open file
descriptors.

Consequences:

- Minimum supported libcurl version has to be bumped to 7.28.0. It was released
  in 2012, 47 vulnerabilities have been fixed since that time - I think it is
  safe to assume that no one should be using older versions today.
- Transmission now respects NOFILE limits that were set by the operating system
  at startup. I believe there is no need in bringing back the `open-file-limit`
  config parameter since the OS already provides decent tools for managing
  limits.
- FD_SETSIZE is still used as the upper bound for some fields in the UI. I have
  no opinion on whether that should be changed, someone more involved with the
  UI should make that decision.
