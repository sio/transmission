Lift 1024 open files limit (switch to curl polling API)

Strict upper bound for file limit was hardcoded into Transmission because
`select()` is unable to handle file descriptors greater than FD_SETSIZE
(usually 1024).

The only place where `select()` was used is `libtransmission/web.c` - as a part
of `curl_multi_*` invocation. Curl has long provided an alternative polling
interface to avoid hitting that limit. This commit replaces curl's older API
(`curl_multi_fdset()` + `select()`) with new polling API (`curl_multi_wait()`)
and removes FD_SETSIZE as the upper bound on the number of open file
descriptors.
